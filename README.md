Examples of using Cobalt's SDKs for iOS devices.

## CubicExample
The CubicExample folder contains code for calling Cobalt's Automatic Speach Recognition system, Cubic.  It is a simple iOS app that streams audio from the device's microphone and calls the specified Cubic Server instance to transcribe it. 

It uses the SDK documented [here](https://cobaltspeech.github.io/sdk-cubic).
